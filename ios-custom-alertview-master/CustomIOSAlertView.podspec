                   The addSubview is not available in UIAlertView in iOS7 or iOS8 any more. The view hierarchy for this
                   class is private and must not be modified. As a solution, this class creates an iOS-style dialog which
                   you can extend with any UIViews or buttons. The animations and the looks are copied too and no images
                   or other resources are needed.
